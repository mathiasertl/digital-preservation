Technology Watch (2 Gruppen, jeweils 1 Person)

The task here is to create an application that monitors certain (sub-)domains on the web. Similar to a web crawler which harvests files from the web this application shall only identify the files' format and keep a log. It shall fulfill the following requirements:

* Keep record on the different file formats that occur and the number of files of that file format
* Detailed specification of the file format. (Identifying files just from their file extension is not sufficient because, for instance, PDF 1.1 and PDF 1.6 are two different file formats.) A tool such as DROID shall be used to identify the file format precisely.
* Send an alert when the number of files of a certain file format drop below a specified threshold (e.g. 10%).

While other solutions are of course possible this application might also be realized as a plug-in for the Heritrix web crawler.
